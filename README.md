# Project topic:
Web Service Composition: Our web app aims to collate and display restaurant reviews from multiple review sources. For the user, this means facilitating easier judgment of what restaurant to eat at based on popular community opinions and metrics important to them (i.e. price). The motivation being that ideally, by using multiple review sources, a user saves time from having to navigate each individual site, and is more readily given access to a holistic view of a chosen restaurant.

# Implemented User stories:
- Must Have:
    - As a user, I want the restaurant reviews to be from different online sources so that I can better select what restaurant is best        suited to me.
    - As a user, I want to be able to view all reviews in one place, regardless of the online source.
    - As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific restaurant name, so that I can only get online reviews about a given              restaurant. 

- Should have
   - As a user, I want to be able to see the price range of the restaurant.
   - As a user, I want to view restaurants based on my location, so that I can narrow restaurants down to somewhere close to me.
   - As a user, I want to be able to view images of the food, restaurant or menu.
   - As a user, I want to be able to view a restaurantâ€™s contact details.
   - As a user, I want to be able to access a the review source so that I can easily explore for further details.

- Could have
  - As a user, I want to be able to compare reviews between two restaurants so that I can more easily judge which one best suits me.
