<h5> Code progress: </h5>
<p>
Issues with rendering images for google, solutions attempted, non found yet. 
Three is enough API’s for now, as long as we can make the code functional and the UI good looking/friendly. 
<p>

<h5> What do we do next? </h5>
<p>Implementation of a back button was brought up, considered if time.
Match the different returned reviews, to try and sort out duplicates.
Still looking for easy solutions
Styling of the reviews list, improve user functionality, maybe divide by source in three different columns.
Possible implementation: compare cards, by displaying them next to each other → compare buttons or something.
Display the correct data from reviews according to user stories
Getting location based search fixed
For yelp and zomato
Updated trello board</p>
